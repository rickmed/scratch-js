who calls endProtocol:
   - genFn failed (threw or returned Err)
      -> need to cancel children if any
   - cancel()


cancel()
   - remove from current Target
   - cancel children if any.
      - wait for them.
   - run onEnds

finishedOK:
   - wait for children.
   - run onEnds


endProtocol():
   if (parked) -> unsub from tg
   if (!childs) -> execOnEnds


waitingChildren, if child failed:
   - could also be that children were cancelled bc genFn failed.
   - if I was cancelled, just continue
      (no need to re trigger children cancel)
   - Otherwise, Depends on CANCEL_SIBLINGS_ON_ERR
